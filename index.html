    <div class="intro">
        <p>I am currently enrolled as undergraduate student at LMU Munich studying computer science.
        I am mostly interested in (no particular order) :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
            <li>Cryptography</li>
        </ul> 
        In my freetime I also enjoy biking, cooking, wakeboarding and chess.

      <b>Training intelligent Agents with Unity ML-Agents Toolkit</b>
    </div>



    <div class="unityp">
      The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit lets you train intelligent Agents inside Unity enviroments. The 
      Agents learn automatically through reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other methods.
      You can check the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents#readme">Readme file</a> for more information. 
    </div>

    <div class="headingp3">
      Installation
    </div>

    <div class="unityp">
      Installation was mostly straightforward. I basically just followed the <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents#readme">Installation guide</a>.
      I would highly recommend to also install the optional <i>com.unity.ml-agents.extensions</i> package and also to make sure that
      you have the <i>com.unity.inputsystem</i> package installed. 
    </div>


    <div class="headingp3">
      Training the first Agent
    </div>

    <div class="unityp">
      Once everything was up and running I could go ahead with training the first agent. To start I chose the 
      basic 3D Ball Model where the agent is getting trained to balance a ball on his head. You can simply start the 
      training by running <i>mlagents-learn config/ppo/3DBall.yaml --run-id=first3DBallRun</i> and pressing the start button in unity.
      You can also train any other of the provided 
      models by replacing the 3DBall.yaml file in the comand. You can see the .yaml files at <i>\ml-agents-release_19\config\ppo</i>.

    </div>

    <div class="unityp">
      I let the model train for around 7 minutes. You can actually see your model training which is pretty cool. 
      The trained model will be saved as an .onnx file which you can then embed into 
      your agent. So this is how the agent performs after 7 Minutes of training:

      Willy the Worm
    </div>

    <div class="unityp">
     One of my favorite enviremonts was the Worm. You can train him to crawl to the the green box. I trained him for around 14 Minutes and he made some
     great progress. Here is the full training video:

    </div>

    <div class="unityp">
      Another cool feature is that you check summary statistics of the Training in TensorBoard with the command: <i>tensorboard --logdir results</i>.
      Here you can see the statistics of Willy training for 14 Minutes.

    <div class="unityp">
      And here is how Willy is performing after 14 Minutes of Training. Pretty good I would say. There are also other interesting enviroments to try out.
